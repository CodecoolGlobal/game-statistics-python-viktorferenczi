Task:

Writing reports that answer Judy's questions. 
Every report needs to be implemented as a function so every function is related to a question. 
For every report function I wrote a printer function also.
The printer function has to print the return value(s) of the report function.



Important:

game_stat.txt: Every line in the file contains the following information about a game:

-title

-total copies sold (million)

-release date

-genre

-publisher




READ ME!



reports.py: Contains only the report functions.

printing.py: Printing the output of the reports in a user friendly way. And ask for information if needed.

export.py: Printing the output of the reports, and putting the outputs in a text file where Judy can see her answers only.





RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

Judy will run printing.py to get the answers she wants. Run export.py if she also needs the answers in a text file.




The part2 is the same with different questions!
